Put datasets here as `./datasets/DIV2K/HR/0801.png`. 

Note: there are two ways to test the model. First, use `GT` mode to load data and generate HR-LR image pairs on-the-fly. 
Second, generating all testing sets at one time and use `GTLQ` mode to load data. Testing sets used in the paper can be generated by
```bash
python prepare_testset.py --opt options/test/prepare_testset.yml
```


For spatially invariant (SI) SR, HR and LR images are put in `HR_si` and `LR_mode0_noise0`, respectively.
For spatially variant (SV) SR, HR and LR images are organized as `HR_sv` and `LR_mode1_noise0`, respectively.
